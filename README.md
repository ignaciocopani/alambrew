# Alambrew
Welcome to Alambrew! The PHP framework that celebrates the art of cutting corners and embracing the "quick fix" mentality. Inspired by the iconic Argentine phrase *"Lo atamos con alambre"* and the spirit of improvisation, Alambrew is your go-to toolkit for developing applications that get the job done... somehow.

## Why "Alambrew"?
The name **Alambrew** is a playful homage to the Argentine musician Ignacio Copani and his song "Lo Atamo' con Alambre". The song humorously critiques the culture of solving problems with makeshift, temporary solutions—exactly what this framework embodies, but in the world of PHP development. Just like in the song, where things are "tied together with wire," this framework is all about embracing the quick fixes, the duct tape, and the band-aids of coding.

## Educational Purpose
While Alambrew is designed as a tongue-in-cheek tool for developers, it also serves an important educational purpose. By intentionally promoting poor coding practices, Alambrew highlights the pitfalls and long-term consequences of "quick fix" solutions. It’s a reminder that while shortcuts may seem convenient, they often lead to code that is difficult to maintain, insecure, and prone to failure.

**Use Alambrew** as a learning tool to recognize bad practices, understand why they are harmful, and ultimately, strive to avoid them in your real-world projects. The contrast between the playful nature of Alambrew and the serious consequences of these practices makes for a unique and memorable learning experience.

## Features
- **Global Variables Everywhere:** Because who needs encapsulation when you can just throw everything into the global scope?
- **Error Suppression by Default:** What you can't see can't hurt you! Alambrew conveniently ignores all those pesky warnings and errors.
- **Spaghetti Code Generator:** Automatically creates code that’s a tangled mess, just like Nonna used to make.
- **Singleton Abuse:** Because everything is better when it's one of a kind, right? Enjoy singleton classes as far as the eye can see.
- **Sarcastic Comment Generator:** Tired of meaningful comments? Let Alambrew auto-generate comments like "This does something important" or "Don't worry about it, it works".
- **No Unit Tests, No Problem:** Achievements unlocked when you successfully avoid writing any tests. Testing is for the weak!
- **Dependency Overload:** Need a simple function? Alambrew ensures you have 30 dependencies for that, just to be sure.
- **Cryptic Function Names:** Why be clear when you can be clever? Functions with names that have nothing to do with what they actually do.
- **Anti-Refactor Police:** Alambrew blocks any attempt to refactor code, reminding you that "Refactoring is for cowards".
- **Support for Outdated PHP Versions:** Why use the latest and greatest when you can stick with PHP 5.4? Security is overrated.
- **Obfuscated Debugging:** Enjoy debugging messages that are as vague and unhelpful as possible. “Something went wrong somewhere.”

## Installation
Simply clone the repository and start building your Alambrew applications. Don’t worry about configuration, it’s probably not going to work anyway.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IgnacioCopani/Alambrew.git
cd alambrew
```
If it works on your machine, then it’s good enough!

## Usage
Create your first Alambrew project with our patented quickfix command:

```bash
php Alambrew quickfix project-name
```
No need to worry about best practices—Alambrew has you covered with the worst ones!

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, but make sure they break something important or introduce at least three new global variables. If you accidentally write good code, it will be rejected immediately.
